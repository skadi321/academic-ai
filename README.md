# System for predicting academic performance

Comparison of Machine Learning Models

## Summary

As a student I have met a wide variety of colleagues with different backgrounds and with varying degrees of academic success. This project's main goal is to use different Machine Learning models to predict how academically successful will someone be. This might provide some insight into what actually matters when it comes to academic success.


## Background

I have not got the chance to learn about Machine Learning as much as I wanted in college, so I choose a topic about Machine learning as my undergraduate thesis. This way I will gain both theoretical and practiacal knowledge about Machine Learning.


## How is it used?

The project can be used to get personal estimation of academic success, specifically time it will take to finnish college. A basic use case would be entering current personal and academic information and getting a prediction regarding time it will take to finnish college.




## Data sources and AI methods
I will use data obtained by scientist at Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre

## Challenges

The main challenge is to create a model that is broad enough so that anyone can use it, but specific enough so that it is useful.
It is important that users understand that the model will generate a prediction and that there is virtually no guarantee that it will be correct.

## What next?

Using borader dataset and optimizing models
